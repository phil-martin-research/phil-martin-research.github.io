I quantify the impact of humans on natural ecosystems and help identify the best solutions to environmental problems. I'm particularly interested in how this applies to forest management and restoration. I have used many different methods in my work, but my main tools have been evidence synthesis methods such as systematic review, meta-analysis, and systematic mapping.

I'm an Ikerbasque research fellow at the Basque Centre for Climate Change where I'm head of a group focussing on the effectiveness of different forest management and restoration interventions for biodiversity and other environmental priorities.
