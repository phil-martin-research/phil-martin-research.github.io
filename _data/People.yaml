- name: Tani Hackney (PhD Student)
  desc: I'm a PhD student based primarily at the University of Bristol. My research uses large global datasets to understand the efficacy of protected areas in promoting functional diversity and resilience of waterbird populations, especially in facilitating their ability to resist and recover from current and future threats.
