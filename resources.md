title: Resources for lab members
---

If you do research you will need to write papers and sometimes give presentations about them. However, it's rare to get taught how to do the things we need to know in order to do these tasks- it's kinda expected that you will just make all this happen. In my experience, this approach doesn't work very well. Theses and papers are often frustratingly badly written, often with ugly figures, and academic talks are often pretty boring, even if the subject matter is actually fascinating.  

To help with this I have created a collection of notes and resources to help researchers 
1. [Write papers](https://github.com/phil-martin-research/researcher_resources/blob/main/writing.md)
2. [Produce figures](https://github.com/phil-martin-research/researcher_resources/blob/main/producing_figures.md)
3. [Give better talks](https://github.com/phil-martin-research/researcher_resources/blob/main/presentations.md). 

I put this collection together for members our team who I thought might find it useful, but if you don't fit into that box and still find this helpful, then great! I plan to refine this collection so I'm happy to take any suggestions for things I could add to the list or things you think need changing.
