If you're interested in collaborating with me or joining our group, please email me at (phil.martin.research[at]gmail.com). Alternatively, if you're interested in the work of one of my group's members , you'll find their email on the 'People' page.

### Where we're based

I'm based at the Basque Centre for Climate Change around a 20 minute journey outside of Bilbao in Spanish Basque Country. I work as part of the Terrestrial Ecosystems research line, which has around 50 members and as well as myself includes people working on the impacts of global change on pollinators and on post-disturbance ecosystem recovery. The centre is extremely diverse meaning you can mix with people working on things related to climate change, but not necessarily related to ecology and conservation.

### Students
If you’re a student interested in working with me, I’d love to have a chat with you! If you want to work with me on a project make sure your email explains why you’re getting in touch with me specifically, make sure to share a bit about yourself, and why you think your research interests are a good fit (and attach a CV!) - this goes for any academic you might be contacting. I am constantly applying for funding for PhD students and these positions will be advertised as they come up. Outside of these opportunities, there are a few highly competitive funding channels for students who have come up with ideas for their own research projects, these include [La Caixa PhD funding for students](https://fundacionlacaixa.org/es/becas?utm_source=sc&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=plan-editorial&utm_content=sem_becas&utm_term=664614&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwhYS_BhD2ARIsAJTMMQbEAJc169PHx7_cS8wK_GEWjpYWyoYvefaXgHS0_5OZToVpdDLJ4v8aArEGEALw_wcB) and [Ramon Areces](https://www.fundacionareces.es/fundacionareces/es/convocatorias/becas-y-ayudas/).

Regarding masters students, I normally advertise a few opportunities for masters projects in October/November each year and will advetise them on this website.

### PostDocs
For postdocs - I'll advertise any funded opportunities on this website as well as the BC3 webpage, but if you're interested in applying for independent funding together I'd love to hear from you. [Marie Curie](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships) and [Ramon Areces](https://www.fundacionareces.es/fundacionareces/es/convocatorias/becas-y-ayudas/) are good places to look for postdoctoral fellowship options.
